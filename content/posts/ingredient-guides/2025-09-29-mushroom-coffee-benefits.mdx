AI-assisted production only works when humans stay sharp. Lately, our editors keep asking
about mushroom coffee—does it actually help when you're wrangling 20 AI drafts a day?

## Why mushroom coffee is trending

There are three reasons the team keeps a French press of chaga blend in the editorial pit:

1. **Stability without jitters.** Lion's mane and chaga deliver a calmer focus window than straight caffeine.
2. **Recovery between sprints.** Beta-glucans modulate stress so writers bounce back after AI QA marathons.
3. **Team ritual.** Sharing a pot before the stand-up sparks healthier conversation than doomscrolling Slack.

TOC is automatically rendered from headings above thanks to the `TableOfContents` component.

### What the science says

A 2023 meta-analysis showed measurable improvements in cognitive flexibility after 30 days of
lion's mane supplementation. That's good news when editors must context-switch between briefs,
SMEs, and fact-checking.

### Rituals matter for creativity

When editors share the same beverage ritual, they indirectly share context. In our case, the
coffee break doubles as a micro-retro: three minutes to call out model hallucinations, link-building
ideas, and subject matter expert gaps.

#### How to test with your team

- Start with a two-week experiment and track how the team feels.
- Only replace one caffeine slot per day so withdrawal doesn't skew the trial.
- Pair the beverage change with improved hydration—still water, not seltzer.

## Turn insights into action

- Document a short "energy ops" playbook so editors know what to expect.
- Use the break to review AI red-flag metrics (confabulations, coverage, SERP shifts).
- Layer the ritual into sprint planning to sustain the habit.

When the team has a predictable energy cadence, it's far easier to spot AI-generated content issues
before they reach the CMS. Mushroom coffee isn't a silver bullet, but it keeps the vibe collaborative.
